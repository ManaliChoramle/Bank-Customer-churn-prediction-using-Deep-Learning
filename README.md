# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using Artificial Neural Networks. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop using a bank's services, which can significantly impact the bank's revenue and customer base. By accurately predicting churn, banks can implement targeted strategies to improve customer retention and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Need for the Project
In the highly competitive banking industry, retaining customers is crucial for sustaining growth and profitability. This project aims to:
- **Identify At-Risk Customers**: Predict which customers are likely to churn, enabling proactive retention efforts.
- **Enhance Customer Experience**: Provide insights into customer behavior and preferences to tailor services accordingly.
- **Optimize Marketing Strategies**: Inform marketing teams on effective approaches to engage and retain customers.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Tools**:
  - TensorFlow/Keras for building and training deep learning models
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing
  - Scikit-learn for model evaluation and metrics
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of bank customer information, including demographic data, account details, transaction history, and whether they have churned.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned and preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical data.
3. **Model Development**: A deep learning model (e.g., Artificial Neural Network) is built using TensorFlow/Keras, designed to predict customer churn based on the input features.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, focusing on the ability to correctly identify churned customers.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in predicting customer churn in the banking sector. By identifying at-risk customers, banks can implement strategies to enhance customer retention and drive long-term growth.
